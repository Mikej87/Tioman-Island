        Pulau Tioman is a duty-free island off Peninsular Malaysia's east coast,
        acclaimed as a geological wonder, ecological paradise and one of
        Southeast Asia's most beautiful travel destinations. Located 32 nautical
        miles off the mainland, but connected through Mersing (Johor) and
        Tanjung Gemuk (Pahang) via ferry, the island continues to enchant
        visitors with its warm beaches, lovely seas and lush greenery. Gazetted
        as a marine park, the immediate waters are abundant with coral reefs and
        marine life - ideal for scuba diving and snorkelling. Much of the island
        is covered by pristine rainforest, home to several endemic wildlife
        species and suitable for nature explorations. Finally, Tioman Island
        attracts youthful travellers from around the world - truly a melting pot
        of cultures to meet on vacation.

          <h2>The History of Tioman</h2>
        </div>
      </section>
      <p>
        Once upon a time, a Chinese dragon princess was in love with a
        Singaporean prince. One day she decided to go to visit him. The powerful
        princess opened her large wings and started flying over the country,
        observing the people below her. After few hours she started passing
        above the sea but decided to continue even when she started to feel
        tired. Suddenly a storm started; exhausted she noticed a beautiful area
        in the crystal clear water of the South China Sea and decided it was
        time to rest. She gently lay down in the water, enjoying the freshness
        and the beauty of the sky, warming her body by the sun. She finally fell
        asleep, completely relaxed by the beautiful atmosphere. When she woke
        she noticed animals who took shelter on her flank. She noticed monkeys
        climbing on her body, colourful fish hiding among her legs and
        travellers relaxing on her belly. Charmed by this atmosphere she
        created, she suddenly realized she should not be enclosed within a
        palace, but could become a princess of the sea offering protection to
        everyone who needed it. Using her power, she dug her legs deep in the
        bottom of the ocean and they became rocks and corals. She deployed her
        wings around her and transformed them into a tree, covering her body
        with jungle. Finally, she gave a last look to the life growing around
        and on her, to the sea she loved so much and to the sky she would never
        cross again and transformed herself entirely into rocks. And Pulau
        Tioman was born, offering a warm shelter in the middle of the ocean.
        Today the twin peaks, the emblematic mount of the island, (which are
        usually surrounded by a small fog) are the last remnants of her horn.
        These remind us of the sacrifice she made and some say you can feel her
        soul still living here, protecting everything and everyone living and
        traveling on the island.
