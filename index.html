      Pulau Tioman is a duty-free island off Peninsular Malaysia's east coast,
      acclaimed as a geological wonder, ecological paradise and one of Southeast
      Asia's most beautiful travel destinations. Located 32 nautical miles off
      the mainland, but connected through Mersing (Johor) and Tanjung Gemuk
      (Pahang) via ferry, the island continues to enchant visitors with its warm
      beaches, lovely seas and lush greenery. Gazetted as a marine park, the
      immediate waters are abundant with coral reefs and marine life - ideal for
      scuba diving and snorkelling. Much of the island is covered by pristine
      rainforest, home to several endemic wildlife species and suitable for
      nature explorations. Finally, Tioman Island attracts youthful travellers
      from around the world - truly a melting pot of cultures to meet on
      vacation.

    <h1>The History of Tioman</h1>
    <img class="image1" src="../dragon.webp" alt="Dragon Image" />

    <p>
      Once upon a time, a Chinese dragon princess was in love with a Singaporean
      prince. One day she decided to go to visit him. The powerful princess
      opened her large wings and started flying over the country, observing the
      people below her. After few hours she started passing above the sea but
      decided to continue even when she started to feel tired. Suddenly a storm
      started; exhausted she noticed a beautiful area in the crystal clear water
      of the South China Sea and decided it was time to rest. She gently lay
      down in the water, enjoying the freshness and the beauty of the sky,
      warming her body by the sun. She finally fell asleep, completely relaxed
      by the beautiful atmosphere. When she woke she noticed animals who took
      shelter on her flank. She noticed monkeys climbing on her body, colourful
      fish hiding among her legs and travellers relaxing on her belly. Charmed
      by this atmosphere she created, she suddenly realized she should not be
      enclosed within a palace, but could become a princess of the sea offering
      protection to everyone who needed it. Using her power, she dug her legs
      deep in the bottom of the ocean and they became rocks and corals. She
      deployed her wings around her and transformed them into a tree, covering
      her body with jungle. Finally, she gave a last look to the life growing
      around and on her, to the sea she loved so much and to the sky she would
      never cross again and transformed herself entirely into rocks. And Pulau
      Tioman was born, offering a warm shelter in the middle of the ocean. Today
      the twin peaks, the emblematic mount of the island, (which are usually
      surrounded by a small fog) are the last remnants of her horn. These remind
      us of the sacrifice she made and some say you can feel her soul still
      living here, protecting everything and everyone living and traveling on
      the island. Tioman Twin Peaks
